<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>I’ve become a bit of a cybersecurity generalist. I’m fortunate to have had the opportunity to try my hand at delivering a bunch of security services - including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing, delivering and continually iterating on cybersecurity courses for <a href="https://itp.nz/">ITP</a> on the <a href="https://itp.nz/events/online/2168-NZISM_Fundamentals">NZISM</a>, <a href="https://itp.nz/courses/ondemand/152-Cybersecurity_Essentials">Cybersecurity Essentials</a> and <a href="https://portal.itp.nz/courses/ondemand/150-Cybersecurity_Incident_Response">Incident Response</a>.</li>
  <li>Creating and delivering customised tabletop exercises for public and private sector clients</li>
  <li>Running cybersecurity awareness training sessions that don’t suck (and the odd keynote here and there)</li>
  <li>In-person, social engineering attacks</li>
  <li>All your standard offensive penetration testing security services (internals, externals, webapp testing, API testing)</li>
  <li>Kuberenetes penetration tests and security reviews (no - this site isn’t hosted on kube - why would you even do that)</li>
  <li>Cloud security reviews and penetration tests (my expertiese is mostly in Azure, but I know enough to break things in AWS and GCP too)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d honestly really like to get my hands on a proper CVE - and have come close a couple of times - but have never quite managed to get a vendor to apply for a CVE as a consequence of my responsible disclosures … yet. And I can be a little bit obsessive about reporting at times and have been known to automate reporting in word and latex.</p>

<h2 id="environmental">Environmental</h2>
<p>I’ve recently been involved with measuring carbon emissions as part of a Toitu certification. It has been a really eye-opening experience which has made me far more aware of the singificant emissions actions of organisations - and just how poorly informed a lot of us are. Through this I’ve been finding lots of motivation to tease out more details about the emissions costs of running compute loads and data storage, and development minimization strategies through changing data centres (Yay Sweden!) and cloud compute workloads (Serverless means lower emissions). I’m particularly curious and shouty about the unknown emissions impact of AI tools at the moment. I try to avoid a myopic focus on carbon emissions alone, and have been looking at broader organisatoinal sustainability frameworks - such as <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/">B Corp</a>.</p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>

<p>If you want to socially engineer me, then it’s probably also helpful to know that I love tabletop role playing games, performing circus, and playing with hydroponics and gardens in my spare time.</p>

<h2 id="previous-life">Previous Life</h2>

<p>In a previous life I did my PhD with the <a href="https://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/">MacDiarmid Institute</a> and then became a Lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington in the School of Engineering and Computer Science, and got some awards for being pretty okay at it. I even published a couple of papers on engineering education practices. So I like to think I know something about educatoin pedagogy.</p>
