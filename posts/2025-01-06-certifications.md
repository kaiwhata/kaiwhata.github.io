# Certifications
After jumping over from penetration testing to cloud blue team work in 2024, I was a little concerned that my pentest skills would atrophy. So I decided to do some of the certs and training that I had been putting off for years and now, 6 months later, I have a whole bunch of new certs. I've realised that online cybersecurity training is still very much the wild west, with MASSIVE disparities and price and quality between different providers - so I decided to write up my experiences so far, to serve as some guidance for anyone else in a similar position. This is gonne get pretty detailed - so if you're looking for a better general guide on how to get into pentesting in NZ, I would recommend instead reading ]Bogan's excellent guide](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/getting-started-penetration-tester-nz-2024-edition-simon-howard-ijntc/) which he keeps updated each year. 

Here's the full list of certs/training that I have attempted or am attempting, their prices (as of time of writing in Jan 2025), and some comments about their quality and cost effectiveness. Note that I'm pretty heavily weighting cost here, as I'm self funding a lot of these so I just can't afford Offsec prices, and I'm comparing only prices for certifications that include training content.

| Certification | Provider | Cost | Progress | Difficulty | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -- |
| Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP/PEN-200) | OffSec | USD$1,749 | | |
| Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) | Microsoft | USD$99 | | |
| Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500) | Microsoft | USD$165 | | |
| Certified Web Application Security Professional (CAWASP) | Altered Security | USD$299 | | |
| Burp Suite Certified Practitioner | PortSwigger | USD$99 | | |
| Cybersecurity Architect Expert (SC-100) | Microsoft | USD$165 | | |
| Certified Azure Red Team Professional (CARTP) | Altered Security | USD$449 | | |
| Practical Mobile Pentest Associate (PMPA) | TCM Security | USD$245 | | |
| Github Advanced Security (GHAS) | Github | USD$99 | | |
| Beginners Guide to IoT and Hardware Hacking (PIPA) | TCM Security | USD$249 | | |
| Practical Web Pentest Professional (PWPP) | TCM Security | USD$499 | | |
| Certified Azure Red Team Expert (CARTE) | Altered Security | USD$499 | | |

It's also worth noting that you can acess all the PortSwigger content for free, and you can access all the TCM content for USD$30/month.
If money wasn't a problem - then I'd ideally go for either OSWE or OSEP (but they're both USD$1,749 each - so that's not happening).
